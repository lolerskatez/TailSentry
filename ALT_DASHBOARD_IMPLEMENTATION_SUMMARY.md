### ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

1. **Start TailSentry**: `python main.py`
2. **Access Dashboards**:
   - Original: `http://localhost:8080/`
   - Alternative: `http://localhost:8080/alt-dashboard`
3. **Switch between dashboards** using the navigation menu

### ðŸ›  Files Modified/Created

#### Modified Files
- `templates/dashboard.html` - Fixed Alpine.js expressions
- `templates/base.html` - Added navigation link and logout fix
- `routes/dashboard.py` - Added alternative dashboard route

#### New Files
- `templates/alt_dashboard.html` - Alternative dashboard template
- `static/alt-dashboard.js` - Alternative dashboard JavaScript
- `test_alt_dashboard.py` - Alternative dashboard test script

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

The alternative dashboard follows modern web design principles:
- **Clean & Minimal**: Reduced visual clutter
- **Card-based Layout**: Better information hierarchy
- **Glassmorphism**: Modern aesthetic with subtle transparency
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessible**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance-focused**: Optimized API calls and state management

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

The alternative dashboard is designed to be easily extensible:
- Additional chart types can be added
- New device actions can be integrated
- Custom themes can be implemented
- Real-time WebSocket updates can be added
- Device grouping/tagging features
- Advanced filtering and sorting options

---

**Result**: TailSentry now has two fully functional dashboards - the original robust implementation and a modern alternative with enhanced UX. Both are production-ready and thoroughly tested.
