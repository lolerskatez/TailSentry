## Device Notifications

The bot automatically monitors your Tailscale network and sends notifications when new devices join.

### Notification Example
```
üñ•Ô∏è New Device Joined Tailnet

Device Name: laptop-new
Device ID: abc123def456
OS: Windows 11
IP Address: 100.64.0.25
First Seen: 2025-09-06T00:20:15Z

TailSentry Device Monitor
```

### Notification Settings

Configure where notifications are sent:

```bash
# Send to specific channel
DISCORD_LOG_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890123456789

# Or let bot find available channels automatically
# (will send to first channel with send permissions)
```

## Security Configuration

### Access Control

Restrict bot usage to specific Discord users:

```bash
# Get Discord User IDs (Developer Mode required in Discord)
DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789012345678,987654321098765432
```

To find Discord User IDs:
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings
2. Right-click on user ‚Üí "Copy User ID"

### Rate Limiting

Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse:
- **10 commands per minute** per user
- **Automatic blocking** after 5 failed attempts
- **Cleanup** of old rate limit data every hour

### Elevated Commands

Some commands require elevated access:
- `/audit_logs` - Security audit trail access

Configure elevated users:
```bash
# Users who can access audit logs and sensitive commands
DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=admin_user_id_here
```

### Data Protection

The bot automatically protects sensitive data:
- **Log Sanitization**: Removes tokens, passwords, and API keys
- **Session Tracking**: Unique session IDs for audit trails
- **Secure Storage**: Tokens and secrets are encrypted

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Appearing

If slash commands don't show up in Discord:

1. **Force Command Sync:**
   ```bash
   python force_sync_discord_commands.py
   ```

2. **Check Bot Permissions:**
   - Ensure bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission
   - Verify bot can send messages in the channel

3. **Wait for Propagation:**
   - Global commands can take up to 1 hour to appear
   - Guild-specific commands appear immediately

### Common Error Messages

#### "Interaction failed"
- **Cause**: Bot lacks permissions or is offline
- **Solution**: Check bot permissions and TailSentry status

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
- **Cause**: Too many commands in short time
- **Solution**: Wait 1 minute and try again

#### "Access temporarily blocked"
- **Cause**: Too many failed authorization attempts
- **Solution**: Wait 1 hour or restart TailSentry

#### "You don't have permission"
- **Cause**: User not in `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` list
- **Solution**: Add user ID to allowed users or remove restriction

#### "Found 1 devices in tailnet" with mock-device
- **Cause**: TailscaleClient import failed, bot using fallback mock data
- **Solution**: Ensure Tailscale is properly installed and `tailscale status` command works
- **Debug**: Check logs for TailscaleClient import errors

#### "/devices shows mock data instead of real devices"
- **Cause**: TailscaleService/TailscaleClient integration issue
- **Solution**: Verify Tailscale installation and permissions
- **Debug**: Run `python test_tailscale_devices.py` to test integration

### Debug Tools

Test bot functionality:
```bash
# Test all Discord bot features
python test_discord_functionality.py

# Debug specific command issues
python debug_discord_commands.py

# Test Tailscale device integration
python test_tailscale_devices.py

# Test Discord bot device integration
python test_discord_device_integration.py
```

### Data Integration Verification

If `/devices` shows mock data instead of real devices:

1. **Check Tailscale Installation:**
   ```bash
   tailscale status
   ```
   Should show your actual devices, not "command not found"

2. **Test TailscaleClient Integration:**
   ```bash
   python test_tailscale_devices.py
   ```
   Should show your real devices with proper field names

3. **Verify Discord Bot Integration:**
   ```bash
   python test_discord_device_integration.py
   ```
   Should confirm bot can access real device data

4. **Check Application Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Look for TailscaleClient import errors
   grep "TailscaleClient" logs/tailsentry.log
   
   # Check for fallback to mock data
   grep "mock data" logs/tailsentry.log
   ```

### Log Analysis

Check TailSentry logs for Discord bot issues:
```bash
# View recent logs
tail -f logs/tailsentry.log | grep discord

# Check for specific errors
grep "discord" logs/tailsentry.log | grep ERROR
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Command Prefix

While slash commands are recommended, prefix commands are also supported:

```bash
DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX=ts!
```

Then use: `ts!status`, `ts!logs`, etc.

### Multiple Discord Servers

The bot can operate in multiple Discord servers simultaneously. Commands will work in any server where the bot has been invited with proper permissions.

### Webhook Integration

For additional notification channels, configure Discord webhooks:

```bash
DISCORD_ENABLED=true
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

### Development Mode

For testing and development:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Test with mock data
TAILSENTRY_FORCE_LIVE_DATA=false
```

## API Integration

The Discord bot integrates with TailSentry's internal APIs:

- **Tailscale Service**: Device information and network status
- **Logging Service**: Application and audit logs
- **Health Service**: System health and metrics
- **Notification Service**: Real-time event handling

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~50MB additional for Discord bot
- **CPU**: Minimal impact (<1% additional usage)
- **Network**: ~1KB per command, ~5KB per notification

### Optimization Tips
- Use `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` to limit access
- Configure specific notification channels to reduce spam
- Monitor audit logs to track usage patterns

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Bot Token Secure**: Never share or commit tokens to version control
2. **Restrict Access**: Use `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` for sensitive environments
3. **Monitor Usage**: Review audit logs regularly
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep Discord.py and TailSentry updated
5. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary Discord permissions

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor audit logs for unauthorized access attempts
- Update Discord bot permissions as needed
- Review and rotate bot tokens periodically

### Getting Help
- Check TailSentry logs for error messages
- Use debug tools to identify configuration issues
- Review Discord Developer Console for bot status
- Consult TailSentry documentation for integration details

## Migration and Updates

When updating TailSentry:
1. Bot configuration is preserved in `.env` file
2. Command registrations are automatically updated
3. Audit logs and user permissions are maintained
4. No additional setup required for existing installations
